This project is templated with jinja2 with python.

The content of the ./src/yio/yio dirctory is beeing templated 4 times, depending on MODE.

There are 4 modes: yio, ywio, yuio and yc16io.

- `yio`
  - normal mode
  - `TCHAR` is `char`
  - `TSTRCHR` is `strchr`
  - etc.
  - `TMODE` is `1/*TMODE*/`
  - `TMODEX` is `1/*TMODEX*/`
  - `TMODEN` is `1`
- `ywio`
  - wide string mode
  - `TCHAR` is `wchar_t`
  - `TMODE` and `TMODEX` and `TMODEN` are `2`
- `yc16io` 
  - UTF-16 string mode
  - `TCHAR` is something around `uint16_t` or `uint_least16_t`
  - `TMODE` and `TMODEX` and `TMODEN` are 3
- `yuio`
  - `UTF-32 string mode
  - `TCHAR` is something around `uint32_t` or `uint_least32_t`
  - `TMODE` and `TMODEN` are 4
  - but `TMODEX` is 3

The files are generated by CMake into BINARY_DIR, and then compiled. All files have to be be generated
before any compilation. The script is in [src/preproces.py](src/preprocess.py).

All files are scanned for `YYIO_ERROR` invokations. Any such invokations are collected into
`yio_error_genmsg.h` and `yio_error_genenum.h` files by `src/geterrors.py` script and then added
with strings as errors.
