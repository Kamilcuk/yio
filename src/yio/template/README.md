# template

Files out of this directory have replaced:

 - `Ω` is replaced by `m4_OMEGA` in `m4_config_template()`
 - `π` is replaced by `m4_PI` in `m4_config_template()`
 
 The variables `m4_OMAGE` and `m4_PI` should be configured by the relevant
 `config_y*io.m4` configuration.
 
For example:
- for wide strings, `s/Ω/W/` and `s/π/w/`

On my keyboard Ω and π can be written easily with key combinations 
alt+q and alt+shift+q. This is the reason why am I using them.
